# Normalization of Laboratory Foliar Nutrient Data

This application is a translation of the Foliar data normalization Microsoft ExcelT spreadsheet (Brockley 2013) to R & RStudio's Shiny interactive web application. More information is available at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/land-based-investment/timber-supply-mitigation/fertilization/fertilization-activity/.


# Instructions
1. Input foliar data for individual nutrients received from the Ministry of Environment (MoE) 
       or Pacific Soil Analysis Inc. (PSAI) in the appropriate "raw data" column.
2. Use "normalized" nutrient values and nutrient ratios for interpretative purposes.

# Notes
1. This "normalization" spreadsheet should only be used with foliar data from MoE or PSAI.
2. For MoE foliar data, only S(ICAP) data (i.e., determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma  
       (ICP) optical emission spectrophotometry) should be used for total S "normalization".
